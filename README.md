# EY-Data-Challenge-Rice-Crop-Identification
Overview: 
Led a team in contributing to a movement aimed at making science more accessible by addressing UN Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. Leveraged radar and optical satellite data from Microsoftâ€™s Planetary Computer to develop open-source solutions for identifying rice crops in Vietnam.

Achievements:
Spearheaded the development of the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI), mimicking NDVI properties, to enhance crop identification accuracy.
Optimized bounding box sizes and coordinated exploration to determine the most effective 5x5 pixel region for analysis.
Focused data extraction on Winter-Spring 2021-2022 and Summer-Autumn 2022 seasons, aligning with rice planting and harvesting cycles.
Implemented a multi-stage data processing approach, categorizing data into planting, middle period, and harvesting bands for improved model learning.
Boosted model performance by tailoring data extraction to crop growth cycles and utilizing a Voting Classifier model, achieving a remarkable 93% accuracy in rice crop identification, a 43% increase from the initial baseline.
